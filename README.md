# AA-Guide

SCRIPT BY OWYN - For TERA
Credits to teralove and soler91 and SHINOYX for their guides

Call out attacks from Antaroth Abyss last boss including both NORMAL MODE & HARD MODE & 7-MAN MODE

*Script automatically detects bosses and which dungeon hard or normal.

Please report any issues to me either here or on discord :)

# Commands 
Only usable in the Antaroth Map. Using of commands outside map will return undefine command.
- !aaguide to toggle module (DEFAULT: ON)
- !toparty to toggle party notice (DEFAULT: SELF ONLY (In notice chat))
- !toparty stream - to toggle messages being sent only to proxy channel, also disables itemhelp (DEFAULT: OFF)
- !itemhelp - turns off\on placing signs on safe spots for right\left swings (DEFAULT: ON)

# Attacks announced
- Front, Back stun
- Back Stun
- Right Safe , OUT safe (Right before the SPIN attack, normally you'd know which side is safe during the spin)
- Left Safe , IN safe (Right before the SPIN attack, normally you'd know which side is safe during the spin)

# Notes
- Left/Right message is announced from Boss POV (aka for DPS guys) - all guides do the same (rk9 guide for last boss for example), so tanks would have to do the opposite, it's not hard, just use itemhelp signs which are placed in safe spots (or your brain lol).
- To change any message - edit index.js with notepad and then rename\delete module.json so it won't autoupdate to how it was before
